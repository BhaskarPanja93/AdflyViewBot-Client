Skip any part if you have it already:
<br>
First go ahead and create an account on <a href=https://windscribe.com/> Windscribe</a> Your VirtualMachine will use this VPN to view AdFly pages from different IPs. Also verify your account for total of 10 GB data per month
<br><br>
Second download the latest version of `user_host_main.exe` file from <a href=https://github.com/BhaskarPanja93/Adfly-View-Bot-Client/releases> Here </a> and run it. 
This file is important and must be run in the same Computer which has all the Virtual Machines.
<br><br>
Once the user_host_main file starts working, it will open a new tab in your browser <a href=http://127.0.0.1:59999>`http://127.0.0.1:59999`</a>, you need to Login in this webpage or Create a new account. Later when you login with the same account, you will be able to control your account and the VMs in that Computer.
<br>
REMEMBER: For security purpose, this link will only be accessible from the same Computer!
<br><br>
Now open `http://[YOUR-COMPUTER-IP]:60000` and login to see and modify your AdFly accounts and Virtual Machines.
This link can be accessed from any device in your network.
<br><br>
Lastly download the latest version of any type from this link:

<h3> Some notations: </h3>

`AdFly ID` refers to the unique number in your AdFly referral code for e.g. for someone with referral code `https://join-adf.ly/654321`, their ID is `654321`
<br><br>
`Identifier text` means any random text that will represent that particular adfly ID in the future (You can also leave it blank!)
<br><br>
`Identifier text` means any random text that will represent that particular adfly ID in the future (You can also leave it blank!)
<br><br>
The user_host_main.exe has capabilities to manage (Turn on and off automatically) the VMs running in your PC (on the basis of Time, System RAM and other factors)
<br>
`VMs controlled by bot` means all the VMs that the metrics apply to. The VM manager will neither start nor turn off any VM that is not added.
<br><br>
`Per VM memory` means the amount of RAM(in MegaBytes) allocated to each VM.
<br><br>
`Max VM count` means the max number of VMs(controlled by bot) that can work at the same time. If more, the manager turns the extras off, If less and other metrics allow more, new VMs will be started.
<br><br>
`Max Memory Percent` means the max RAM percent that your system can reach. If more, the manager turns off extra VMs that it controls. If less and other metrics allow more, new VMs will be started.
<br><br>
Want to use your Device for the whole day, and you want the bots to work only for a certain time during the night?
`Bot Start Time` and `Bot Stop Time` does it for you. According to the System time, VM manager will turn VMs on or off.
<br><br>
<h2>And This Should Work!!!</h2>

<h3>Some Advanced Stuff:</h3>
* Go slow or you might get banned by AdFly. <br>
Yes you can run several copies of the VM and run them all together, this will scale up your Earning.
But there is a chance that your AdFly account might get banned for using this bot at a fast rate. Go slow, take your time, Run lesser number of VMs initially, find what is the best rate for you, then gradually increase if you want to. <br><br>
* Don't blame me if any AdFly account gets banned
***Remember If your AdFly ID gets banned, its withdrawal email gets frozen (You can't add that withdrawal email to a new AdFly account) so always bind disposable AdFly accounts to this bot*** <br>
Create fake AdFly IDs to use with this bot, accounts that won't cause problems if banned. AdFly allows account creation with disposable emails https://www.emailondeck.com/ and https://www.mohmal.com/en <br><br>
* This bot is still in its Beta phase.
Meaning there are still bugs, issues, and thus need lots of improvements, maybe you incur a bug, some unexpected behaviour, kindly report it as soon as possible, This bot is always open for suggestions, new ideas or fixes.<br><br>
* Multiple VMs can be run at the same time.
The code I made is extremely efficient, and you can run multiple VMs at once. To do so, either download a fresher copy of VM from Google link, or you can clone the VM ***before logging into WindScribe***, if you clone after login, it might cause problems because of same account active in 2 devices. Same Username(of my server) can however be used in multiple VMs.
